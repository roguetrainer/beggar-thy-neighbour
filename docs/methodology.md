# Methodology: The Economics of Class Wars

This document explains the economic framework used in *Trade Wars Are Class Wars* (Klein & Pettis, 2020) and how this project visualizes it using World Bank data.

Robinson has a biting, famous line about the stupidity of retaliatory tariffs:

## 1. The Core Identity
The analysis relies on the fundamental national accounting identity:

$$ CA = S - I $$

Where:
* **CA** = Current Account Balance (Trade Surplus/Deficit)
* **S** = National Savings
* **I** = Domestic Investment

### The Implication
A trade surplus ($CA > 0$) is **mathematically identical** to an excess of savings over investment ($S > I$).
A trade deficit ($CA < 0$) is **mathematically identical** to an excess of investment over savings ($I > S$).

Pettis and Klein argue that these imbalances are not caused by "better manufacturing" or "lazy consumers," but by distortions in income distribution that force $S$ and $I$ apart.

## 2. The Surplus Genesis (China & Germany)
In surplus countries, domestic policies (e.g., wage suppression, weak social safety nets, or subsidies for manufacturing) transfer wealth from households (who consume) to elites/corporations (who save).

* **Visual Evidence:** In the charts, you will see the **Gross Domestic Savings** line rise significantly above the **Investment** line.
* **The "Class War":** This gap represents consumption that *did not happen* because workers were not paid a high enough share of what they produced. This excess production must be exported.

## 3. The Deficit Mirror (The United States)
The world is a closed system. One country's surplus must be another's deficit. The US, with its deep, open financial markets, acts as the "consumer of last resort."

* **Visual Evidence:** In the charts, you will see US **Investment** consistently floating *above* US **Savings**.
* **The Misconception:** This is often blamed on Americans "spending beyond their means."
* **The Reality:** Foreign capital (the excess savings from China/Germany) flows into the US, pushing up asset prices and the dollar, which suppresses US savings and manufacturing competitiveness, *forcing* the deficit required to absorb the foreign surplus.

## 4. Household Consumption Share
The most direct measure of the "Class War" is **Household Final Consumption Expenditure as a % of GDP**.

* **Low Share:** Indicates that households retain a small slice of the economic pie (common in surplus nations).
* **High Share:** Indicates households retain more purchasing power (common in deficit nations).

By plotting these lines for China, Germany, and the US, we can see the structural divergence that drives trade conflict.
