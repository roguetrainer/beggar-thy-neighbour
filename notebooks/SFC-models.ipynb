    "# The Mathematics of Trade Wars: Stock-Flow Consistent (SFC) Modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "**Based on the work of Michael Pettis, Matthew Klein, and Joan Robinson.**\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook moves beyond historical data visualization to **theoretical simulation**. We will use Stock-Flow Consistent (SFC) models to demonstrate why the current global arrangement of persistent trade imbalances is mathematically unsustainable.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Core Theory\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. The Accounting Identity\n",
    "$$ CA = S - I $$\n",
    "A Current Account Surplus ($CA > 0$) effectively means a country is saving more than it invests ($S > I$). It must export this excess capital abroad.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. The Global Constraint\n",
    "The world is a closed economy. The sum of all Current Account balances must equal zero.\n",
    "$$ \\sum CA_{world} = 0 $$\n",
    "Therefore, if Country A runs a structural surplus (via \"Beggar-thy-neighbour\" policies), Country B **must** run a deficit.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. The Debt Trap (Stock-Flow Consistency)\n",
    "Mainstream economics often focuses on flows (GDP, Annual Trade Deficit). SFC models focus on **Stocks** (Debt, Net Wealth).\n",
    "\n",
    "If the interest rate on debt ($r$) is higher than the economic growth rate ($g$), a debtor nation ($CA < 0$) will see its debt-to-GDP ratio explode exponentially, even if it stops buying foreign goods. This is the **\"Snowball Effect.\"**"

    "## Limitations & Theoretical Assumptions\n",
    "\n",
    "Before running the models, it is important to address what this model includes and excludes, particularly regarding **Money Creation** and **Exchange Rates**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Why no \"Money Printing\"?\n",
    "In international accounting, printing money (expanding the central bank balance sheet) does not erase external debt. \n",
    "* If the US prints dollars to pay for imports, foreign exporters (or their central banks) end up holding those dollars.\n",
    "* Those dollars represent a claim on the US (a liability). \n",
    "* Therefore, printing money changes the **composition** of the Net International Investment Position (NIIP) from bonds to currency, but it does not improve the *Net* position. The country remains a debtor.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Why no Exchange Rates?\n",
    "Standard economics assumes that if a country runs a deficit, its currency will depreciate, making its exports cheaper and fixing the imbalance. \n",
    "* **The Pettis/Klein Thesis** argues that this mechanism is broken. Surplus nations (like China or Germany) effectively **peg** their currencies or recycle surpluses into deficit assets regardless of price.\n",
    "* By omitting flexible exchange rates, this model simulates a world where **capital flows drive trade**, and prices are unable to adjust to clear the market—which Pettis argues is exactly the world we live in.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. The Definition of \"SFC\" here\n",
    "This is a **Partial SFC Model**. It tracks the consistency of **International** Stocks (Net Foreign Assets) and Flows (Current Account). It does not model domestic sectoral balances (Households vs Firms vs Banks) explicitly, but bundles them into the national aggregate."

    "2.  **The Deficit Bloc (e.g., USA):** Acts as the consumer of last resort, absorbing the surplus.\n",

    "### Key Takeaways from Model 2\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Stagnation is Dangerous:** Germany and Japan have explosive wealth accumulation (NIIP) largely because their GDP growth ($g$) is low while their trade surplus is high. They are extracting demand from the world faster than they are growing.\n",
    "2.  **China's Stabilization:** China's NIIP trajectory is flatter because its GDP growth rate ($g=5\\%$) is higher than the global interest rate ($r=4\\%$). High growth \"dilutes\" the accumulated wealth stock relative to the size of the economy.\n",
    "3.  **The US Limit:** The red line in the first chart shows the US Net Position diving toward -100% of GDP and beyond. In reality, a financial crisis or a hard political pivot (Trade War) would occur long before this mathematical limit is reached."
