I just released a new open-source project that visualizes one of the most compelling economic arguments I've encountered: the Pettis-Klein thesis from "Trade Wars Are Class Wars."

The project, called "beggar-thy-neighbour," uses Python and live World Bank data to show how domestic income inequality and consumption suppression in surplus nations like China and Germany create global trade imbalances that deficit nations like the US are forced to absorb.

The thesis is fascinating: what we call "trade wars" are actually the international manifestation of domestic class wars. When countries suppress household consumption and wages, they're forced to run large trade surpluses, effectively exporting their economic problems to trading partners.

The repository includes:
✓ Python scripts that fetch live data from the World Bank API
✓ Interactive Jupyter notebooks for exploring the data
✓ Automated chart generation showing the relationship between suppressed consumption and trade surpluses
✓ Full documentation of the methodology

All code is MIT licensed and designed to be reproducible. No manual data downloads required.

This is more than just an economics visualization project. It's about understanding how domestic policy choices in one country ripple through the global economy, affecting workers and communities thousands of miles away.

If you're interested in international economics, data visualization, or the intersection of domestic and trade policy, check it out on GitHub. Would love to hear your thoughts or see what insights you discover in the data.
