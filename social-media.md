🙄 IT'S THE ECONOMIC ACCOUNTING IDENTITY, STUPID! 📉
🪖 Are Trade Wars Actually Just Domestic Class Wars? 🤔
🌍 BEGGAR-THY-NEIGHBOUR: Robinson, Pettis & Klein on Global Imbalances ⚖️

We love to blame trade wars on geopolitics, tariffs, or "unfair" practices. But Michael Pettis and Matthew Klein argue that the real culprit is much simpler - and much harder to fix.

It comes down to one equation: 
        CA = S - I
(Current Account = Savings - Investment).

When surplus nations suppress consumption to boost savings, those savings *must* go somewhere. The deficit nations don't have a choice but to absorb them.

If a country creates policies that force up domestic savings (by suppressing worker wages), it *mathematically* must export that excess capital. And the rest of the world *mathematically* must absorb it.

Joan Robinson realized that because the world is a closed economy, one nation's surplus is mathematically another's deficit—meaning you cannot cure your own stagnation without 'beggaring' your neighbour. Indeed, she was one of the primary architects of that logic. As a key member of the "Cambridge Circus" — the group of economists who helped John Maynard Keynes critique and refine The General Theory — she was instrumental in defining exactly how these macro-accounting identities work.

If you want to see this mechanism in action, try the repo "beggar-thy-neighbour" to visualize it - scripts pull World Bank data to plot the period during which the "savings glut" formed and how it mirrors the US deficit.

I just released a new open-source project that visualizes one of the most compelling economic arguments I've encountered: the Pettis-Klein thesis from "Trade Wars Are Class Wars."

The project, called "beggar-thy-neighbour," uses Python and live World Bank data to show how domestic income inequality and consumption suppression in surplus nations like China and Germany create global trade imbalances that deficit nations like the US are forced to absorb.

The thesis is fascinating: what we call "trade wars" are actually the international manifestation of domestic class wars. When countries suppress household consumption and wages, they're forced to run large trade surpluses, effectively exporting their economic problems to trading partners.

The repository includes:
✓ Python scripts that fetch live data from the World Bank API
✓ Interactive Jupyter notebooks for exploring the data
✓ Automated chart generation showing the relationship between suppressed consumption and trade surpluses
✓ Full documentation of the methodology

All code is MIT licensed and designed to be reproducible. No manual data downloads required.

This is more than just an economics visualization project. It's about understanding how domestic policy choices in one country ripple through the global economy, affecting workers and communities thousands of miles away.

If you're interested in international economics, data visualization, or the intersection of domestic and trade policy, check it out on GitHub. Would love to hear your thoughts or see what insights you discover in the data.

Here are the updated LinkedIn post options with that phrase integrated. It works best as a punchy standalone line to cut through the noise.

**Option 1: The "Hot Take" Style (Best for engagement)**

**Headline: It's the economic accounting identity, stupid! 📉**

We love to blame trade wars on geopolitics, tariffs, or "unfair" practices. But Michael Pettis and Matthew Klein argue that the real culprit is much simpler—and much harder to fix.

It comes down to one equation: **CA = S - I** (Current Account = Savings - Investment).

If a country creates policies that force up domestic savings (by suppressing worker wages), it *mathematically* must export that excess capital. And the rest of the world *mathematically* must absorb it.

I built a new Python project—"beggar-thy-neighbour"—to prove this with data.

It fetches live World Bank records to visualize how the "class wars" inside surplus nations (like China and Germany) force trade deficits on the US.

**Option 2: Integrated into the Narrative**

Why do persistent global trade imbalances exist?

We often hear about currency manipulation or strategic rivalry. But in their book "Trade Wars Are Class Wars," Pettis and Klein point to a different culprit: domestic income inequality.

Their argument isn't just theory. **It's the economic accounting identity, stupid!**

When surplus nations suppress consumption to boost savings, those savings *must* go somewhere. The deficit nations don't have a choice but to absorb them.

I wanted to see this mechanism in action, so I wrote some Python code to visualize it. My new repo pulls World Bank data to plot the exact moment the "savings glut" formed and how it mirrors the US deficit.

**Option 3: Short & Punchy**

Trade wars aren't about foreign policy. They are about math.

 specifically: **It's the economic accounting identity, stupid!** 🧮

If Country A creates excess savings by underpaying workers, Country B *must* run a deficit to absorb it. That is the core thesis of "Trade Wars Are Class Wars."

I built a GitHub repo to visualize this inescapable logic using Python and live economic data.

**Option 1: The Data-Driven / Technical Approach (Best for data science/finance audiences)**

Why do persistent global trade imbalances exist? According to Michael Pettis and Matthew Klein in their phenomenal book "Trade Wars Are Class Wars," the answer lies not in geopolitical rivalry, but in domestic income inequality.

It’s a compelling thesis, but I wanted to see the actual data behind it.

I’ve just published a new GitHub repository—called "beggar-thy-neighbour"—that uses Python to programmatically fetch live data from the World Bank API to visualize their core arguments.

The repo contains notebooks and scripts that generate charts illustrating:

📉 The Surplus Genesis: How declining household consumption shares in nations like China and Germany force savings rates above investment rates.

📈 The Deficit Mirror: How the US financial system absorbs this excess global capital, forcing its own investment to exceed savings.

It is a fascinating exercise in using national accounting identities to understand real-world conflict. The charts make it incredibly clear how domestic policies that suppress worker wages eventually manifest as international trade tension.

Check out the code, the methodology docs, and the generated charts below. 👇

**Option 2: The Economic Insight Approach (Best for a general professional audience)**

We often hear that trade wars are battles between nations competing for dominance.

But what if the real battle is happening inside those nations?

I recently finished building a data project based on the brilliant book "Trade Wars Are Class Wars" by Michael Pettis and Matthew Klein. Their central argument, rooting back to economist Joan Robinson's concept of "beggar-thy-neighbour" policies, is that global trade imbalances are caused by domestic income inequality.

When surplus countries (like Germany or China) implement policies that suppress domestic household consumption in favor of corporate savings, that excess production has to go somewhere. It gets exported, forcing deficit nations (like the US) to absorb the capital and run trade deficits.

I wanted to visualize this "class war" dynamic. 🧑‍💻

Using Python and open World Bank data, I created a repository that generates the charts proving this thesis. It visually demonstrates the massive divergence in savings and investment behavior between surplus and deficit nations over the last two decades.

If you are interested in macroeconomics, global trade, or just seeing how theory translates into data, take a look at the repo.

🌍 What do you think? Are trade imbalances primarily a domestic political issue?

**Option 3: Short & Punchy**

Trade wars are often just the international spillover of domestic class wars. 💥

That is the thesis of the excellent book by Michael Pettis and Matthew Klein. They argue that when countries suppress domestic wages and consumption to boost competitiveness (a "beggar-thy-neighbour" policy), it creates massive global imbalances that lead to conflict.

I built a GitHub repository to visualize this theory using real-world data.

Using Python to pull directly from the World Bank, this project plots the relationship between suppressed household income in surplus nations and rising deficits elsewhere.

The charts are eye-opening. You can see the code and the results here 👇
